You can replace DWRITE_FONT_STYLE_NORMAL with DWRITE_FONT_STYLE_ITALIC, and use DWRITE_FONT_WEIGHT_BOLD for the weight, with CreateTextFormat.\r<br />\nIt can also be overridden in a created text-layout with IDWriteTextLayout::SetFontWeight / SetFontStyle, which can be used to make only part of a string italic / bold.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou can also use those flags in a FW1_FONTWRAPPERCREATEPARAMS structure when creating the font-wrapper object, if you want default text to be italic. See the Transforms sample for how to use that structure. It's probably not that useful though since it would make all DrawString texts be italic..\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nIt would good feature to have easier available... I'll add a flag for it if I make another update, but for now a text-layout has to be created.\r<br />\n<br />\n/Erik<br />\n",
