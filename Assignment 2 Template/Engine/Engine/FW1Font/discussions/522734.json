Currently you have these options<br />\n<pre><code>// Define if building a DLL for the font-wrapper\n#define FW1_COMPILETODLL\n\n// Define to use LoadLibrary instead of linking to DLLs\n//#define FW1_DELAYLOAD_DWRITE_DLL\n//#define FW1_DELAYLOAD_D3DCOMPILER_XX_DLL</code></pre>\n\nFW1_COMPILETODLL is only option which produces .lib(only 3kb?) file but it also produces FW1FontWrapper.dll file which I need to put in my main executable folder for my  own dll to work.<br />\n",
