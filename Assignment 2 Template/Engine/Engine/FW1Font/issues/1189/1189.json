    "Description": "I made a test project in which I have an animation and FPS textbox using FW1FontWrapper. I have noticed that sometimes the FPS drops randomly to between 100 - 900 FPS instead of the usual 3000 FPS inside Visual Studio. This problem does not occur when I run the executable outside Visual Studio. The only call I make during my rendering loop is FW1FontWrapper DrawString() and the issue is resolved if I comment out this call:\n\n```\n\t\tfontWrapper->DrawString(\n\t\t\tthis->immediateContext,\n\t\t\ttext.c_str(),\n\t\t\tfamily.c_str(), // Family\n\t\t\tsize,\n\t\t\tposX,\n\t\t\tposY,\n\t\t\tcolor,\n\t\t\tFW1_ALIASED | FW1_RESTORESTATE\n\t\t\t);\n```\n\nAny idea what causes this problem? Using Visual Studio 2013 on Windows 8.1.",
