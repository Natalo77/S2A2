    "Description": "I had problems running a release build of a project using FW1FontWrapper as a static library. In the FW1 project properties->configuration properties->c/c++->code generation->runtime library, the setting was \"Multi-threaded (/MT)\". I believe it should be \"Multi-threaded DLL (/MD)\". I hope this saves someone the time it took me to figure out.\n\nThanks for the project! Having fun with it, and will possibly be using in college instruction.",
